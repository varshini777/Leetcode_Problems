# Reverse a Doubly Linked List
# Given a doubly linked list. Your task is to reverse the doubly linked list and return its head.
# Input: LinkedList: 3 <-> 4 <-> 5
# Output: 5 <-> 4 <-> 3

# Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

# Constraints:
# 1 <= number of nodes <= 106
# 0 <= node->data <= 104

#Approach
